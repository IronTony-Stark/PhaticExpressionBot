I'm afraid I don't understand you
Sorry, but I don't get you
Looks like we are not on the same page. Could you explain everything again?

Such a terrible weather. Do you have the same?
Today was really wonderful weather.) And what about your?

Anything else?
Tell me something interesting?)
Tell me about your day?
What's new?

Maybe you will add something else?
Could you explain, please?
Oh, I really haven't figured that out, could you explain, please?

Sorry for interrupting you, but how are your parents?
Interesting.) Do you have siblings?
I see. Maybe you tell me something about your family?
